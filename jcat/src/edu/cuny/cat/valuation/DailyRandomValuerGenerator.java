	 * Synchronization: Threads communicate primarily by sharing access to
	 * fields and the objects reference fields refer to. This form of
	 * communication is extremely efficient, but makes two kinds of errors
	 * possible: thread interference and memory consistency errors. The tool
	 * needed to prevent these errors is synchronization.
	 * 
	 * Below we get an example of a synchronized method. I think the reason we
	 * do this here is because the object is threaded...but I don't actually
	 * know. In essence the synchronized method makes sure that only one such
	 * method can act on a given object at a time when you have concurrent
	 * threads.
	 * 
	 * The method returns an object of class ValuationPolicy. We initialize a
	 * RandomValuer and make it final so that threads can't try and access it
	 * before its actually been created.
	 * 
	 * I'm not exactly sure what "this" refers to in this context. I guess its
	 * an object of class DailyRandomValuerGenerator.
